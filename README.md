Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository!  
This repo contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized for easy revision and consistent learning.

## 📁 Structure

1)The solutions are grouped by difficulty level:

Each file follows this naming convention :      <problem-number>-<problem-name>.py
